        <h1 id="title"><u>Ganyu</u></h1>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p id="tribute-info"><strong>Ganyu</strong> is a fictional character from the game "Genshin Impact". Widely regarded as one of the strongest characters a player could have on their account (as of April 2022), Ganyu combines extremely high damage multipliers on a charge attack with a wide area ultimate ability with "quadratic scaling". In-universe she is one of the "Adepti", a group of mythical, illuminated (enlightened) beasts and immortals who act as guardians of the nation of "Liyue". She also serves as the secretary to the governing body of Liyue, the "Liyue Qixing".

        <ul><h3>Personality</h3>
            <li> Ganyu has a very strong work ethic, often staying up for long nights in order to finish the day's paperwork. Such a attitude likely stems from the contract she made with the God of Liyue, to protect all living things within the nation.</li>
            <li> Ganyu is somewhat shy, owing to her half-Qilin (mythical beast) lineage, which manifests itself in the form of her red horns. She sometimes laments that these may alienate her from the human population in Liyue, and so refers to them as merely a headpiece.</li>
            <li> She is also easily embarrassed, when the topics of her childhood or weight is brought up, due to a peculiar incident where she was swallowed whole by a monster but choked it to death by not being able to fit down its throat. </li>
        </ul>
      <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <ul> <h3>Abilities</h3>
            <li> Normal attack: Performs 6 consecutive bow attacks dealing physical damage
            <li> Charged attack: Fires a single arrow dealing Cryo damage which deals a further instance of Cryo damage in an area around impact
            <li> E ability: Dashes backwards, whilst dealing 1 instance of Cryo damage around the initial location. Leaves behind a timed decoy which taunts nearby enemies and deals 1 instance of cryo damage on expiry or destruction.
            <li> Q ability: Rains down icicles within a large circular area which deal Cryo damage in a small area around impact. The large circular area is centered around the character's position at the time of cast.
        </ul>
        <ol> <h3>Constellation - Sinae Unicornis</h3>

            <li>  Additional charge of E (backward dash) ability </li>
            <li>  Increase level of Q (icicle shower) ability </li>
            <li>  Enemies standing within the radius of Q (icicle shower) ability take progressively more damage </li>
            <li>  Increase level of E (backward dash) ability </li>
            <li>  Upon using E (backward dash) ability, next charged shot is instant</li>
        </ol>

          <p>Whilst Ganyu's abilities are fairly unassuming and non-flashy compared to other characters, her charged attack deals extremely high damage and in a fairly generous area, meaning unlike many other characters, much of her damage is not only ranged, but also not gated behind the cooldown of an E or Q ability allowing her to constantly output large amounts of Cryo damage to an area. Her Q ability being a "placed" ability means she can cast it and swap out for a teammate, allowing her to also be used as a supportive character.  A more in depth look at her ablities may be found on the
